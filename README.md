## Introduction

In the realm of video game development, creating unique characters for millions of players can be a daunting task. However, with the advent of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), this task becomes more manageable. GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks capable of generating new data that adheres to the statistical characteristics of the training set. One specific application of GANs, known as Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with GANs to generate realistic images.

In this project, we delve into the realm of anime character creation using DCGANs implemented in Keras. By harnessing the capabilities of GANs, we aim to automate the process of generating unique anime avatars for a large player base in an online video game.

## Objectives

Upon completing this project, we will:
